    "The purpose of this document is to give a gentle introduction to supervised learning and linear regression in a nutshell. The application of linear regression to predicting the hotel room prices. Linear regression is arguably the simplest model used in regression and supervised learning. Besides its simplicity and scalability, another important advantage of linear regression is that it is well interpretable. Both the modeling details, the case study, and the  Python code are included in this document.\n",

    "- Mathematics enables us to represent some concepts, ideas, and implementations **neatly**, **succintly**, and **elegantly**, which would otherwise be impossible or very cumbersome.\n",

    "Supervised learning refers to a wide variety of machine learning task through which one seeks to identify the underlying relationship between the ($p-$dimensional) feature $X=(X_1,X_2,...,X_p)'\\in\\mathbb R^p$ ( ' is the transpose operation for a matrix ) and label $Y\\in\\mathbb R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, $Y$ is the key variable of interest, whose value is so important for decision making that we wish to predict as accurate as possible. Typical examples of $Y$ in applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The daily active users (DAU) and daily usage time per user of an app like Tiktok.\n",
    "- The amount of money a user uses to purchase products on Amazon per year.\n",
    "- The wage of a worker in a certain industry segment.\n",
    "- Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature and practical applications, $Y$ also has some other names such as dependent variable, response variable, target variable, output variable, outcome variable, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature vector $X$ contains the variable(s) that could be used to explain and/or predict $Y$. The key value of the features $X$ lies in their capability to accurately predict $Y$. Typical examples of $X$ in applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user demographic data of an App.\n",
    "- The user behavior data of an App.\n",
    "- The characteristics of a product.\n",
    "- Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In different contexts, $X$ may have some other names such as independent variable, covariate, predictor, explanatory variable, input variable, data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, we seek to build a learner (aka model) $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ based on the training data set of sample size $n$,\n",
    "$$\\mathcal D:=\\{(Y_i,X_i):Y_i\\in\\mathbb R,X_{i}\\in\\mathbb R^p,1\\le i\\le n\\}$$ \n",
    "that predicts the ourcome $Y$ from feature $X$ of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i\\approx\\hat Y_i:=\\hat f(X_i)\\mbox{ for all }i=1,2,...,n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\approx$ refers to \"as close as possible\", or some kind of error is minimized. In this course, we use the notation $\\hat{}$ to represent what is generated from data. At a high level, we train our model $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ to make as few mistakes as possible (on the training set):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal L(\\hat f(X_i),Y_i)\\mbox{ is minimized, where }\\mathcal L(\\cdot,\\cdot)\\mbox{ is some error measure between the predicted value}\\hat f(X_i)\\mbox{ and true value }Y_i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We will discuss some specific loss functions later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "With supervised learning, we generally aim at achieving the following by identifying a good candidate of $\\hat f(\\cdot)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand which of the features in $X$ actually have some (significant) relationships with $Y$.\n",
    "- Characterize whether the association/correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is positive or negative.\n",
    "- Identify the weight of each feature in the vector $X$ on the outcome $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce some examples of supervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use movie features (genre, actors, average rating, length, etc.) and user features (age, gender, location, ratings given to other films, etc.) to predict the rating a user will give to a movie s/he has never watched before.\n",
    "- Use user past behaviors to predict his/her total app time of Kwai tomorrow.\n",
    "- Use email texts and figures to predict whether it is a spam.\n",
    "- Use CT scan images to predict whether the patient has lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of supervised learning, regression and classification. For regression, $Y$ is a real-valued continuous variable such as rating, app time, price, etc. The commonly used loss/error functions in regression are squared error $\\mathcal L(\\hat f(X_i),Y_i)=(\\hat f(X_i)-Y_i)^2$ and absolute error $\\mathcal L(\\hat f(X_i),Y_i)=|\\hat f(X_i)-Y_i|$, etc. For classification, $Y$ a factor/categorical variable (i.e., taking discrete values, such as in binary classification, $Y\\in\\{0,1\\}$). Examples $Y$ in classification problems include whether an email is a spam, whether a patient has cancer, and whether a customer will purchase a product, etc. Commonly used loss functions in classification problems include the zero-one loss $\\mathcal L(\\hat f(X_i),Y_i)=1\\{Y_i\\ne \\hat f(X_i)\\}=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,\\mbox{ if }Y_i\\ne \\hat f(X_i)\\\\\n",
    "0,\\mbox{ otherwise},\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be useful to preview and discuss the similarities and differences between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. From a similarity point of view, both approaches attempt to model data, address certain practical problems, and eventually deliver business and societal values. The key difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning aims to directly model the relationship between features and label, so that labels in new data can be accurately predicted given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning finds patterns/relationships/structures in data without being optimized to solve a particular predictive task (i.e., there is not label $Y$ for unsupervised learning)."

    "Linear regression is arguably the simplest supervised learning model. The key assumption for linear regression is that the label $Y$ and feature $X$ has a linear relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i=\\beta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_jX_{ij}+\\epsilon_{i},\\mbox{ for }i=1,2,...,n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_j$ is the coefficient for feature $j$ and $\\epsilon_i$ is a random noise which is independently and identically distributed (called i.i.d. in statistics text books, see this [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables)) with mean 0 and finite variance ($\\mathbb E[\\epsilon_i]=0$ and $\\mathbb E[\\epsilon_i^2]<+\\infty$). The question is now reduced to estimate the value of $\\beta=(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,...,\\beta_p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote $\\hat\\beta=(\\hat\\beta_0,\\hat\\beta_1,...\\hat\\beta_p)$ as the estimation of $\\beta$ fitted on the data set $$\\mathcal D:=\\{(Y_i,X_i):Y_i\\in\\mathbb R,X_{i}\\in\\mathbb R^p,1\\le i\\le n\\}$$ \n",
    "The most commonly adopted method to fit a linear regression model is ordinary least squares (OLS, see this [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat\\beta=\\mbox{argmin}_{\\beta}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\\beta_0-\\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_jX_{ij})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As is clear from the definition, the OLS estimate $\\hat\\beta$ minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE), which is very easy to compute. In other words, the loss function is the squared loss: $\\mathcal L(Y,\\hat Y)=(Y-\\hat Y)^2$. An important property of OLS is that it penalizes more on larger errors due to the squared error. In general, the squred error can also be used to predict the conditional mean of the label $Y$ given feature $X$, $f(X):=\\mathbb E [Y|X]$. The estimator of $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat f(\\cdot)=\\mbox{argmin}_{f(\\cdot)}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-f(X_i))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this section, we remark that, the estimated coefficient for feature $j$, $\\hat \\beta_j$ ($1\\le j\\le p$) can be interpreted as \"one unit of change in $X_j$ is associated with $\\hat\\beta_j$ units of change in $Y$\". We will get back to the interpretation problem of linear regression models later in this notebook."

It is also the improvement (in label variance reduction) of the \"best\" linear regression model over the baseline model that ignores all the features. One should note that $R^2$ is universally interpretable across different models, but not a good metric to compare for different models. Furthermore, we use the same data to fit the model and to evaluate it (so, $R^2$ is an in-sample measure of fit). Hence, a model with a large (resp. small) $R^2$ may still be poor (resp. good).\n",

    "Recall that the in-sample $R^2$ measures the fitness between the linear regression model and the training data. However, we are more interested in understanding how well the model will perform on a **new** and unseen data set. To address this question, we introduce the notion of out-of-sample $R^2$, which evaluates the $R^2$ metric on a new data set not overlapping with the data used to fit the model. We refer to the data set for fitting the model as the training set, denoted as $\\mathcal D_{tr}$ and the data set for evaluating the performance of the model as the testing set, denoted as $\\mathcal D_{te}$. The sample size of the training set is denoted by $n_{tr}=|\\mathcal D_{tr}|$ and the sample size of the testing set is denoted by $n_{te}=|\\mathcal D_{te}|$. Computing the out-of-sample $R^2$ measure comprises of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1. Data Splitting.** Randomly split the entire data set $\\mathcal D$ into non-overlapping training set $\\mathcal D_{tr}$ and testing set $\\mathcal D_{te}$. The sample size proportion is roughly $n_{tr}:n_{te}=7:3$ or $n_{tr}:n_{te}=6:4$.\n",
    "- **Step 2. Model Training.** Train a linear regression model $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ (using OLS) on the training set $\\mathcal D_{tr}$.\n",
    "- **Step 3. Model Evaluation.** Compute the out-of-sample $R^2$ on the testing set $\\mathcal D_{te}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{OOS-}R^2=1-\\frac{\\sum_{(X,Y)\\in\\mathcal D_{te}}(Y-\\hat f(X))^2}{\\sum_{(X,Y)\\in\\mathcal D_{te}}(Y-\\bar Y_{tr})^2},\\mbox{ where $\\bar Y_{tr}:=\\frac{1}{n_{tr}}\\sum_{(X,Y)\\in\\mathcal D_{tr}}Y$ is the average outcome of the training set.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the OOS-$R^2$ and the in-sample $R^2$ reveals a key property of the former metric that it is evaluated on a **different** data set. As such, we are not playing the roles of players and referees simultaneously, so the out-of-sample $R^2$ is a fair metric to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model on unseen data. One should note that higher in-sample $R^2$ does not necessarily imply higher out-of-sample $R^2$, due to overfitting. Furthermore, in theory, the out-of-sample $R^2$ is always upper-bounded by 1, but could be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use OOS-$R^2$ to evaluate the performance of the two linear regression models built above."

    "Linear regression is arguably the **simplest** supervised learning model for regression (predicting a continuous label). It assumes a linear relationship between the label and the features and the estimation seeks to minimize the MSE (mean-squared error) of all training observations. We use the in-sample $R^2$ (which is lower-bounded by 0 and upper-bounded by 1) to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the linear regression model. As for the prediction accuracy, the basic metric is the out-of-sample $R^2$, which compares the squared error of the linear regression model and that of the naive prediction without using any features. Linear regression has great interpretability, but you should be cautious not to confuse correlation with causation. "
